Haven't posted in years so here are some pics (of many to come) from Iceland 1 year+ ago #throwback LMAO

Wild trip w/ mah bois & gals

2nd pic: the day I passed away at the glacier
4th pic: the day we understood the meaning of "strong" winds
Last pic: our Michelin 3 star meal of Maggi on the 1st night (no it was not a snack, it was our dinner :')) 

Creds @lzc_97 @sonseca_97 for taking the 1st pic and the 6th pic
