Moments before sunrise. 

Alishan, Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ 18/03/2023

Not pictured: waking up at 3 am, and then sprinting in the thin mountain air at 4 am to catch the last sunrise train. And finally squeezing with 100 other ppl to get the nice photo spots ðŸ¤¡

Lyrics
'""
Daylight blows into one door and out of the other
Bathing you and then taking you out of its shine
So you watch as the winds rise and clouds lose their colour
Understand it was only a matter of time
