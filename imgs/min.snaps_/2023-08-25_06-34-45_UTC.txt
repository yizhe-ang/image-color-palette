Looking over Seoul

Hiking inwangsan was not easy after pedalling the rail bike alone (big mistake LMAO) the previous day... but the views were unforgettable ☺️

Lyrics
"""
Hollow
Carve the words from your tongue
Fall on your misfortune
Don't speak
Shadow
In the shape of what I once was
A whisper I could once trust
Pulled from me
.
Who
Who's to blame a promise
Spoke when it was honest
Then broken the same
Oh, All I ever wanted
Was to crawl into your arctic
And hold you unscathed
"""
