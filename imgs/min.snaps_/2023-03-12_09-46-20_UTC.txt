Gwanghwamun 🇰🇷 26/01/2023

When it started snowing super heavily I knew I had to change my plans to go back to Gyeongbokgung to see it covered in snow.

Swipe to the 2nd slide and keep watching for how heavy the snow was 🤩😍 Not my 1st time seeing snow but for some reason it really hits different from the snow I experienced back in Canada 2019. 

What I felt can't be explained in words, but I hope these few photos and videos can at least convey part of it to you

눈으로 뒤덮인 광화문... 할말도 없네...아무 말로 어떻게든 설명 못하는 느낌 🥲🫡. 

Was bummed initially cuz the few days prior to this Seoul was hit by a bad cold wave (-20 deg) but it was a blessing in disguise hehehe

Stay tuned for more photos of the interior of gyeongbokgung that day 🤭
며칠 후에 경복궁 안에 찍었던 예쁜예쁜 사진들 더 업로드 해줄게 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
